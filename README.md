# TMSandboxTesting2

This is new project strcture based on Maven. 

1. using Maven to generate project structure (create Maven project from Eclipse)
2. Add dependencies Jave libraries into Maven pom.xml
3. adjust necessary naming convention changes

Assumption:
1. The acceptance criteria is to satisfy all 3 conditions, and if we need more detail failure message we can separate into 3 tests.
2. Based on current API, I see no appid/token or authorization/authentication needed. Can be adjusted if needed.
